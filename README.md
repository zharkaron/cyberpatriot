All of this scripts are made for the ubuntu image im not sure if its going to work for other distributions

use the user.sh properly double check all of the users are properly added to a file and run the script 
sudo ./user.sh <file_name>
this is going to delete and add all users that are in the file so make sure to add administrators

use the adm.sh properly double check all of the admins are in the file else its going to add or remove them run 
sudo ./adm.sh <file_name>
this is going to remove and add all admins from the system that are not in the system


ufw.sh is just made to enable the firewall

apt.sh has not been tested yet it should set the daily updates to automatic and update your own computer once its
once its done writing the input into the file tested and works but not sure if its going to give points yet
to be soon tested
